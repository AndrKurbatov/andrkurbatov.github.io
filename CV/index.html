                    <h3 class="content-title">About me</h3>
                    <p>Steven Paul Jobs, born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California, U.S., cofounder of Apple
                        Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era.
                        American inventor, designer and entrepreneur the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of
                        Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are
                        seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology.
                        My observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the
                        things that change this industry are both the ‘thinker-doer’ in one person. And if we really go
                        back and we examine, did Leonardo (da Vinci) have a guy off to the side that was thinking five
                        years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of
                        course not. Leonardo was the artist but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly
                        good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those
                        skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was the exceptional
                        result.
                        And there is no difference in our industry. It’s very easy to say, ‘oh I thought of this three
                        years ago.’ But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did
                        it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: you have
                        to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
                    </p>

                                bought the company. Pixar is now "the" digital animation studio.
                                We have created and produced half of the top grossing animated films of all time,
                                including: Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, and Monsters, Inc.</p>

                            <p>Founded NeXT Software Inc., which created really cool hardware that exploited the full

                                users) lives a whole lot easier, thus giving them more leisure time to go catch the

                            <p>Invested heavily in funding start-up company (Sold my VW mini-bus).
                                Apple ignited the personal computer revolution with "insanely great" products such as
                                the Apple II. Took the company public in 1980 at $22 per share. Later, in 1984, we
                                reinvented the personal computer with the Macintosh.

                                Learned many things, including do's and don'ts for building executive teams.

                                Left in 1986 to decide which step to take NeXT.</p>
